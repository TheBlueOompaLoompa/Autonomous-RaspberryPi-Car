# Autonomous RaspberryPi Car
## What it was made on
This project was made almost entirely on a Raspberry Pi 4 B 4GB Model.

## About
At this point in time it is still in early development so don't expect to have a car driving from your house to someone else's.
Right Now all you can do is detect different sides of the road(it isn't very good at it.)
I will be updating it over time to hopefully add motor controls, and create a way of planning out a route.
A Download link is avalible on the [Scratchysoft Website](https://scratchysoft.github.io)

## How To Install

1. Install the required components

To install the python3 opencv package and make sure you have all the updated packages required open up a terminal and run:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
```

2. Use git to download the project
cd into your desired install folder in the terminal then type:
```
git clone https://github.com/TheBlueOompaLoompa/Autonomous-RaspberryPi-Car.git
cd Autonomous-RaspberryPi-Car
```

3. Run the code!
In the terminal window type:
```
python3 autopi.py
```

**Now You Have A Working Autonomous RaspberryPi Car (Eventually)**
